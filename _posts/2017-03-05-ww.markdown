```
NO labor-saving machine,	 
Nor discovery have I made;	 
Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found a hospital or library,	 
Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage, for America,	 
Nor literary success, nor intellect—nor book for the book-shelf;	         5
Only a few carols, vibrating through the air, I leave,	 
For comrades and lovers.
```

No Labor-Saving Machine   
Walt Whitman (1819–1892)  
Leaves of Grass  
1900
